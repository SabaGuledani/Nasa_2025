      "Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters -Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.\n",

      "Ionizing radiation is known to cause DNA damage, yet the mechanisms underlying potential transgenerational effects of exposure have been scarcely studied. Previously, we observed effects in offspring of zebrafish exposed to gamma radiation during gametogenesis. Here, we hypothesize that these effects are accompanied by changes of DNA methylation possibly inherited by subsequent generations. We assessed DNA methylation in F1 embryos (5.5 hours post fertilization) with whole genome bisulfite sequencing following parental exposure to 8.7 mGy/h for 27 days and found 5658 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). DMRs were predominantly located at known regulatory regions, such as gene promoters and enhancers. Pathway analysis indicated the involvement of DMRs related to similar pathways found with gene expression analysis, such as development, apoptosis and cancers, which could be linked to previous observed developmental defects and genomic instability in the offspring. Follow up of 19 F1 DMRs in F2 and F3 embryos revealed persistent effects up to the F3 generation at 5 regions. These results indicate that ionizing radiation related effects in offspring can be linked to DNA methylation changes that partly can persist over generations. Monitoring DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker to provide an indication of ancestral exposures to ionizing radiation.\n",

      "The objective of the Rodent Research-23 missions (RR-23) was to better understand the effects of spaceflight on the eyes, specifically on the structure and function of the arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels that are needed to maintain vision. To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks old mice were delivered to the ISS on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (Jan 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Cerebellums were preserved by immersion in RNAlater and stored at -80 ˚C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the HGC group, and 8 samples from the VGC group. A technical replicate is included for one sample in each group. These consist of an independent library preparation for a single RNA extraction.\n",

      "M. marinum is a fish pathogen that usually only infects human skin, but it is genetically related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and has similar pathogenic mechanisms to these human pathogens. M. marinum and M. avium have been found in biofilms in water distribution systems and showerheads. Therefore, M. marinum is a biosafety level 2 model organism for biofilm-forming pathogenic mycobacteria. M. marinum prefer to form biofilms on hydrophobic surfaces and hydrophobic materials are used on the ISS, an example is silicone. In this study we wanted to examine the transcriptome changes of M. marinum exposed to simulated microgravity in biofilm-promoting medium. M. marinum expressing red fluorescent protein were grown in biofilm-promoting medium in flaskettes containing a piece of PDMS membrane attached to the slide. After filling the flaskettes, cultures were shipped to Kennedy Space station overnight. The flaskettes were attached to the RPM 2.0, or a lab-designed 3D clinostat which were positioned in the same incubator. For the normal gravity control, the flaskette was positioned on the shelf next to the microgravity simulators. After 4 days at 31 degrees C, the bacteria in suspension were used to prepare RNA and RNA-seq was performed to examine gene expression changes.\n",

      "A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceflight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies offer minimally invasive alternatives to traditional tissue biopsies, while also permitting the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids, which may resolve molecular heterogeneity and extend the multi-omics scope better than standard methods. Full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. Here, we perform a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days, and show that plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) can capture longitudinal gene expression responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. Analysis of cfRNA collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirmed previously reported mitochondria dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identified an extracellular mitochondria (exMT)-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing analysis of the CD36 fraction revealed various tissue origins, some of which have not been well characterized due to their conventional inaccessibility. We compared our data to plasma cfRNA mouse data from a JAXA mission, in which on-board artificial gravity had been used, and discovered that microgravity induced the observed systemic responses. Our study used minimally invasive approaches to demonstrate exMT release as a conserved process in space and establishes the impact of gravity on Earth as an essential signal for normal homeostasis.\n",

      "Differential organ growth during gravitropic response is caused by differential accumulation of auxin, that is, relative higher auxin concentration in lower flanks than in upper flanks of responding organs. Auxin responsive reporter systems such as DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP have usually been used as indicators of gravitropic response in roots and hypocotyls of Arabidopsis. However, in the inflorescence stems, the reporter systems don't work well to monitor gravitropic response. Here, we aim to certify appropriate gravitropic response indicators (GRIs) in inflorescence stems. We performed microarray analysis comparing gene expression profiles between upper and lower flanks of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems after gravistimulation. Thirty genes showed greater than 2-fold differentially increased expression in lower flanks at 30 min, of which 19 were auxin response genes. We focused on IAA5 and IAA2 and verified whether they are appropriate GRIs by real-time qRT-PCR analyses. Transcript levels of IAA5 and IAA2 were remarkably higher in lower flanks than in upper flanks after gravistimulation. The biased IAA5 or IAA2 expression is disappeared in sgr2-1 mutant which is defective in gravity perception, indicating that gravity perception process is essential for formation of the biased gene expression during gravitropism. IAA5 expression was remarkably increased in lower flanks at 30 min after gravistimulation, whereas IAA2 expression was gradually decreased in upper flanks in a time-dependent manner. Therefore, we conclude that IAA5 is a sensitive GRI to monitor asymmetric auxin signaling caused by gravistimulation in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems.\n",

      "The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects is a chief concern. More recently, it has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression of neuroinflammation panel for inflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38+4 hours of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. Habitat ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. The Neuroinflammation panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p less than 0.05) significantly segregates the GC group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated in FLT compared to the GC mice. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to antiviral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. These data indicate that neuroinflammation and altered immune reactions may be closely associate with spaceflight-induced stress response and have an impact on the neuronal function that may result in chronic neuroinflammation and late neurodegeneration. A total of 12 frozen right caudal half hemispheres containing mid- and hindbrain from GC and FLT mice (n equals 6 per group), were used for analysis\n",

In this study, we investigate the effect of simulated spaceflight microgravity facilitated by parabolic flights on tissue-engineered cartilage developed from chondrogenically differentiated human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells obtained from age-matched female and male donors. Our bulk transcriptome data via RNA sequencing demonstrated that the engineered tissues responded to parabolic microgravity in a sex-dependent manner.\n",

      "Electrophysiological alterations of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) with unloading are poorly studied. We aimed to investigate these aspects and the underlying molecular mechanisms with short-term unloading and active recovery (AR). Eleven healthy males underwent a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) period, followed by 21-day AR based on resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris (QF) cross-sectional area (CSA) and isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were evaluated. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings were obtained during 10% and 25% MVC isometric contractions from the vastus lateralis (VL). Biomarkers of NMJ molecular instability (serum c-terminal agrin fragment, CAF), axonal damage (neurofilament light chain) and denervation status were assessed from blood samples and VL biopsies. NMJ and ion channel transcriptomic profiles were investigated by RNA-sequencing. QF CSA and MVC decreased with ULLS. Increased CAF and altered NMJ transcriptome with unloading suggested the emergence of NMJ molecular instability, which was not associated with impaired NMJ transmission stability. Instead, increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates were found after ULLS. Downregulation of ion channel gene expression was found together with increased neurofilament light chain concentration and partial denervation. The AR period restored most of these neuromuscular alterations. In conclusion, the human NMJ is destabilized at the molecular level but shows functional resilience to a 10-day unloading period at least at relatively low contraction intensities. However, MUP properties are altered by ULLS, possibly due to alterations in ion channel dynamics and initial axonal damage and denervation. These changes are fully reversed by 21 days of AR. KEY POINTS: We used integrative electrophysiological and molecular approaches to comprehensively investigate changes in neuromuscular integrity and function after a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), followed by 21 days of active recovery in young healthy men, with a particular focus on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) properties alterations. After 10-day ULLS, we found significant NMJ molecular alterations in the absence of NMJ transmission stability impairment. These findings suggest that the human NMJ is functionally resilient against insults and stresses induced by short-term disuse at least at relatively low contraction intensities, at which low-threshold, slow-type motor units are recruited. Intramuscular electromyography analysis revealed that unloading caused increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates, and these alterations could be related to the observed changes in skeletal muscle ion channel pool and initial and partial signs of fibre denervation and axonal damage. The active recovery period restored these neuromuscular changes.\n",

      "The effects of short-term confinement on gene expression profiles in blood were evaluated. Fourteen days confinement study was conducted 2 times. In each experiment, 8 male subjects were stayed in an isolation and confinement facility at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. DNA microarray of extracted RNA from whole blood samples revealed that the expression levels of 3,659 genes were significantly altered by the 14-day confinement. The changes in gene expression profiles were not exactly the same as those in response to the other stress conditions, such as chronic psychological stress and spaceflight. In particular, 7 genes, LIN9, AK125040.1, MGC45922, C9orf173-AS1, OR1P1P, KRTAP10-12, and ARFRP1, responded to the confinement prominently. Therefore, the analysis of expression levels of these genes might be useful to assess the stress responses of human body to the confinement. In addition, biological interpretation of the alteration of gene expression profiles with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that 14-day confinement stimulated various signaling related to pro inflammation and leukocyte extravasation but suppressed apoptosis signaling. In agreement with the interpretation, the decrease of white blood cells in blood was confirmed during the confinement. On the other hand, red blood cells and platelets did not decrease. These results suggest that 14-day confinement is likely to induce shift of white blood cells from “the circulating pool” to “the marginated pool”.\n",

      "In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the astronaut’s health. To gain insight into the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in response to radiation and microgravity, we analyzed RNA expression profiles in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells incubated for 24 h in static condition or in rotating condition to stimulate microgravity in space after 2 Gy γ-ray irradiation. Expression of 14 lncRNAs and 17 mRNAs was found to be significantly down-regulated in the simulated microgravity condition. In contrast, irradiation up-regulated the expression of 55 lncRNAs and 56 mRNAs, while only one lncRNA, but no mRNA, was down-regulated. Furthermore, 2 miRNAs, 70 lncRNAs, and 87 mRNAs showed significantly altered expression under simulated microgravity after irradiation, and these changes were independently induced by irradiation and simulated microgravity. Together, our results indicate that simulated microgravity and irradiation additively and independently alter the expression of RNAs and their target genes in human lymphoblastoid cells.\n",

      "Microgravity produces a variety of physical, chemical, and biological cues leading to an intricate and largely unresolved network of mechanosensitive molecules, transduction pathways, oxidative stress-related responses, and adaptations. The bone loss observed in astronauts and animal models after spaceflight is attributable to alterations in the bone tissue formation that depends on the continuous remodelling through the activities of bone-resorbing osteoclasts of hematopoietic lineage and bone-forming osteoblast of mesenchymal origin. Focusing on osteogenic differentiation, we present the results of the ”SCD - Stem Cells Differentiation” experiment, aiming to determine how human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) react to a prolonged (approx. 2 weeks) exposure to microgravity in terms of growth, and differentiation when treated with a physiological osteo-inducer as 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (Vit D3). The experiment was selected by the European Space Agency and transferred to ISS with the Soyuz-TMA- 16M (ISS 42S). It was carefully prepared because experiments performed on ISS remain a uniquely exceptional means of clarifying the microgravitational effects on osteogenesis, often only partially activated and detectable under simulated conditions. Because of the substantial reduction in calcification observed (about 50% inflight vs. on-ground control), we looked at significantly affected pathways in hBMSCs grown in microgravity vs. on-ground controls. Genome-wide expression changes were assessed via microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) and integrated with exosomal mi-RNA measurements. Multi-scale pathway analysis of the omics datasets revealed evidence of cell cycle arrest, occurring with a number of osteogenic gene markers, but without indications of adipogenesis, senescence and/or apoptosis.\n",

      "The diamagnetic levitation as a novel ground-based model for simulating a reduced gravity environment has recently been applied in life science research. In this study a specially designed superconducting magnet with a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF), which can provide three apparent gravity levels (μ-g, 1-g, and 2-g), was used to simulate a space-like gravity environment. Osteocyte, as the most important mechanosensor in bone, takes a pivotal position in mediating the mechano-induced bone remodeling. In this study, the effects of LG-HMF on gene expression profiling of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were investigated by Affymetrix DNA microarray. LG-HMF affected osteocyte gene expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and data mining were further analyzed by using bioinfomatic tools, such as DAVID, iReport. 12 energy metabolism related genes (PFKL, AK4, ALDOC, COX7A1, STC1, ADM, CA9, CA12, P4HA1, APLN, GPR35 and GPR84) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. An integrated gene interaction network of 12 DEGs was constructed. Bio-data mining showed that genes involved in glucose metabolic process and apoptosis changed notablly. Our results demostrated that LG-HMF affected the expression of energy metabolism related genes in osteocyte. The identification of sensitive genes to special environments may provide some potential targets for preventing and treating bone loss or osteoporosis.\n",

      "Microorganisms' natural ability to live as organized multicellular communities – also known as biofilms – provides them with unique survival advantages. For instance, biofilms are protected against environmental stresses thanks to their extracellular matrix, which could contribute to persistent infections after treatment. Biofilms are also capable of strongly attaching to surfaces, where their metabolism byproducts could lead to surface material degradation. Furthermore, microgravity can alter biofilm behavior in unexpected ways, making the presence of biofilms in space a risk for both astronauts and spaceflight hardware. Despite the efforts to eliminate microorganism contamination from spacecrafts surfaces, it is impossible to prevent human-associated bacteria or fungus from eventually establishing biofilm surface colonization. Nevertheless, by understanding the changes that biofilms undergo in microgravity, it is possible to identify key differences and pathways that could be targeted to significantly reduce biofilm formation. The Space Biofilms project, performed at the International Space Station, contributes to such understanding by characterizing the morphology and gene expression of bacterial and fungal biofilms formed in microgravity with respect to ground controls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as model organism for the bacterial morphology and transcriptomic studies, while Penicillium rubens was used for the fungal morphology study. Bacterial biofilm formation was characterized at one, two, and three days of incubation (37°C) over six different materials: stainless steel 316, passivated stainless steel 316, a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS), catheter grade silicone with and without a linear microtopography, and cellulose membrane.\n",

      "Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment. This dataset is from the micro-computed tomography, immunostaining, and histology assays.\n",

At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain).

      "Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.\n",

      "Exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation is an innate risk of the spaceflight environment that can cause DNA damage and altered cellular function. In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-exposure for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions. This study includes data from adrenal samples only.\n",

      "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from Molecular Cellular Imaging (Microscopy) assay.\n",

One of these biospecimen collections included whole blood collected via venipuncture, with serum extracted from blood using a serum separator tube (SST). Samples were collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Serum samples were submitted for immune and cardiovascular cytokine biomarker profiling panels at two different companies (Eve Technologies and Alamar), and to Quest Diagnostics for comprehensive metabolic panel testing. Data was used to measure changes in cytokines and metabolic measures during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Multiplex assays, and the blood serum data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-569 (whole blood), OSD-570 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), OSD-571 (plasma), OSD-572 (skin, oral, and nasal swabs), OSD-573 (Dragon capsule samples), OSD-574 (skin biopsy), OSD-656 (urine), and OSD-630 (stool).\n",

      "The objective of the Rodent Research-23 mission (RR-23) was to better understand the effects of spaceflight on the eyes, specifically on the structure and function of the arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels that are needed to maintain vision. To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight, 20 Habitat Ground Control (HGC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (Flight and HGC) or vivarium cages (VGC), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. Flight, HGC and VGC animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Right tibialis anterior muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 150 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the HGC group, and 9 samples from the VGC group.\n",

      "From our previous work we have shown a key miRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight can be used as a biomarker and countermeasure to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we have further expanded on this work to determine key biological factors that are being rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on our established 3D microvessel cell cultures (i.e. 3D Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)) exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs (i.e. antagomirs). In addition we have an additional set of samples studying the impact a specific miRNA, miR-2392, which was overexpressed in the 3D tissues. miR-2392 is known to be involved in different diseases and we were studying the impact of miR-2392 overexpression in the 3D microvessel tissues.\n",

      "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (GC; 10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (BSL; 10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (VIV; 10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing ribodepleted gene expression data from hearts from 5 old and 5 young animals from each of the following groups: LAR basal, LAR ground control, LAR vivarium control, LAR flight, ISS-T basal, ISS-T ground control, and ISS-T flight. The ISS-T vivarium control young group has only 3 animals due to quality control issues.\n",

      "In the last decade, the exploration of deep space has become the objective of the national space programs of many countries. The International Space Exploration Coordination Group has set a roadmap whose long-range strategy envisions the expansion of human presence in the solar system to progress with exploration and knowledge and to accelerate innovation. Crewed missions to Mars could be envisaged by 2040. In this scenario, finding ways to use the local resources for the provision of food, construction materials, propellants, pharmaceuticals is needed. Plants are important resources for deep space manned missions because they produce phytochemicals of pharmaceutical relevance, are sources of food and provide oxygen which is crucial in bioregenerative life support systems. Growth analysis and plant biomass yield have been previously evaluated on Martian regolith simulants; however, molecular approaches employing gene expression analysis and proteomics are still missing. The present work aims at filling this gap by providing molecular data on a representative member of the Poaceae, Lolium multiflorum Lam., grown on potting soil and a Martian regolith simulant (MMS-1). The molecular data were complemented with optical microscopy of root/leaf tissues and physico-chemical analyses. The results show that the plants grew for 2 weeks on regolith simulants. The leaves were bent downwards and chlorotic, the roots developed a lacunar aerenchyma and small brownish deposits containing Fe were observed. Gene expression analysis and proteomics revealed changes in transcripts related to the phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, primary metabolism and proteins involved in translation and DNA methylation. Additionally, the growth of plants slightly but significantly modified the pH of the regolith simulants. The results here presented constitute a useful resource to get a comprehensive understanding of the major factors impacting the growth of plants on MMS-1.\n",

      "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and remeasured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight. This dataset derives results from the intraocular pressure (tonometry) assay.\n",

      "Natural background radiation is a permanent multicomponent factor. It has an influence on biological organisms, but effects of its deprivation still remain unclear. The aim of our work was to study for the first time responses of D. melanogaster to conditions of the Deep Underground Low-Background Laboratory DULB-4900 (BNO, INR, RAS, Russia) at the transcriptome level by RNA-seq profiling. Overall 77 transcripts demonstrated differential abundance between flies exposed to low and natural background radiation. Enriched biological process functional categories were established for all genes with differential expression. The results showed down-regulation of primary metabolic processes and up-regulation of both the immune system process and the response to stimuli. The comparative analysis of our data and publicly available transcriptome data on D. melanogaster exposed to low and high doses of ionizing radiation did not reveal common DEGs in them. We hypothesize that the observed changes in gene expression can be explained by the influence of the underground conditions in DULB-4900, in particular, by the lack of stimuli. Thus, our study challenges the validity of the LNT model for the region of background radiation doses below a certain level (~16.4 nGy h-1) and the presence of a dose threshold for D. melanogaster.\n",

      "Purpose: Astronauts traveling beyond low Earth orbit will be exposed to high linear energy transfer charged particles. Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs γ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to γ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of α smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than γ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the western blot, histology, and immunohistochemistry assays.\n",

      "Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to spaceflight microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight. This study derives results from the immunohistochemistry (cellular and molecular imaging) assay from whole brains.\n",

      "Human space exploration missions will continue the development of sustainable plant cultivation in what are obviously novel habitat settings. Effective pathology mitigation strategies are needed to cope with plant disease outbreaks in any space-based plant growth system. However, few technologies currently exist for space-based diagnosis of plant pathogens. Therefore, we developed a method of extracting plant nucleic acid that will facilitate the rapid diagnosis of plant diseases for future spaceflight applications. The microHomogenizer from Claremont BioSolutions, originally designed for bacterial and animal tissue samples, was evaluated for plant–microbial nucleic acid extractions. The microHomogenizer is an appealing device in that it provides automation and containment capabilities that would be required in spaceflight applications. Two different plant pathosystems were used to assess the versatility of the extraction process. Tomato and lettuce plants were respectively inoculated with a fungal plant pathogen, an oomycete pathogen, and a plant viral pathogen. The microHomogenizer, along with the developed protocols, proved to be an effective mechanism for producing DNA from two pathosystems, in that PCR and sequencing of the resulting samples demonstrated clear DNA-based diagnoses. Thus, this investigation advances the efforts to automate nucleic acid extraction for future plant disease diagnosis in space.\n",

      "Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.\n",

      "Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n  equals 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the pQCT assay using tibia tissue.\n",

      "The response of the brain to space radiation is an important concern for astronauts during space missions. We assessed the response of the brain to 28Si ion irradiation (600 MeV/n), a heavy ion present in the space environment, on cognitive performance and whether the response is associated with altered DNA methylation in the hippocampus, a brain area important for cognitive performance. At 0.3 Gy, but not at 0.6 Gy or 0.9 Gy, 28Si ion irradiation impaired cognition that correlated with altered gene expression and 5hmC profiles that mapped to specific gene ontology pathways. Comparing hippocampal DNA hydroxymethylation following proton, 56Fe ion, and 28Si ion irradiation revealed a general space radiation synaptic signature with 45 genes that are associated with profound phenotypes. The most significant categories were glutamatergic synapse and postsynaptic density. Thus, the brain’s response to space irradiation involves novel excitatory synapse and postsynaptic remodeling.\n",

      "The objective of the Rodent Research-10 mission (RR-10) was to investigate how spaceflight affects the cellular and molecular mechanisms of normal bone tissue regeneration in space. To this end, ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6129SF2/J Wild Type (WT), and ten (10) 14-15 weeks-old female B6;129S2-Cdkn1atm1Tyj/J (p21-null) mice received a pre-flight subcutaneous injection of the bone marker (Alizarin Red), and were then delivered to the ISS aboard SpaceX-21. At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing data from left cerebral hemispheres from 4 WT flight animals and 5 WT ground control animals, and single nuclei transcriptomics and epigenomics data from left cerebral hemispheres from 5 WT flight animals, and 5 WT ground control animals.\n",

      "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing and single nuclei transcriptomics and epigenomics from left cerebral hemispheres from 4 young ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 old ISS-T spaceflight animals, 5 young ISS-T ground control animals, and 4 young ISS-T ground control animals.\n",

      "This study was conducted to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). Based on our previous space flight studies using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware on the STS-131 Space Shuttle mission, we found that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. This follow-up spaceflight experiment called the Advanced Plant EXperiments (APEX 03-1) in Space was designed to use Veggie unit on the ISS and on the ground unit on the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) to probe deeper into spaceflight-induced cell wall associated transcript expression changes. In this study we used RNA-Seq in combination with glycome profiling (glycomics) to correlate spaceflight-induced gene expression changes with actual cell wall modifications within seedlings.\n",

      "Gonadal hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, modulate muscle size and strength in males and females. However, the influence of sex hormones on muscle strength in micro- and partial-gravity environments (e.g., the Moon or Mars) is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of gonadectomy (castration/ovariectomy) on progression of muscle atrophy in both micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fischer rats (n equals 120) underwent castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham surgery (SHAM) at 11 weeks of age. After 2 weeks of recovery, rats were exposed to hindlimb unloading (0g), partial weight bearing at 40% of normal loading (0.4g, Martian gravity), or normal loading (1.0g) for 28 days. In males, CAST did not exacerbate body weight loss or other metrics of musculoskeletal health. In females, OVX animals tended to have greater body weight loss and greater gastrocnemius loss. Within 7 days of exposure to either microgravity or partial gravity, females had detectable changes to estrous cycle, with greater time spent in low-estradiol phases diestrus and metestrus (∼47% in 1g vs. 58% in 0g and 72% in 0.4g animals, P equals 0.005). We conclude that in males testosterone deficiency at the initiation of unloading has little effect on the trajectory of muscle loss. In females, initial low estradiol status may result in greater musculoskeletal losses. This study derives results from Force Plate.\n",

      "Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6‐month‐old female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the behavior assays Balance Beam, Elevated Plus Maze, Open Field, Three Chamber Social Approach, Novel Object Recognition, and Radial Arm Water Maze using the same source animals as the flow cytometry blood samples in OSD-640.\n",

      "The PESTO experiment was launched on April 8, 2002 onboard STS-110 (Atlantis) and was returned on June 19, 2002 onboard STS-111 (Endeavor), a total of 73 days in space. The ground control was conducted on a 14-day delay, and was harvested on July 3, 2002. During this period there were a total of 7 harvests of PESTO wheat and priming of 6 wheat root modules on orbit. A total of 18 plants were fixed on orbit for morphological and structural analysis, 4 plants were fixed for RNA and molecular genetic analysis and greater than 150 plants were frozen for biochemical analysis. A total of 3018 images of wheat chambers were collected from the BPS cameras during flight, and 3,640 images were obtained from the ground controls. A total of 65 digital images of the wheat harvest were collected during flight, with 75 being collected from ground controls. In addition, crew members recorded approximately 50 images and over 3 hrs of video of flight operations. Over 2 gigabytes of environmental data were obtained from the flight and ground control units. A ground control experiment was conducted in the BPS ground control chamber in the Orbiter Environment Simulator (OES) at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Site Support Facility in Hangar L. The ground control was delayed by 14-days from the real- time flight operations in order to duplicate the flight operations as closely as possible in a 1 g environment. At launch, two chambers were dedicated to the PESTO study, which consisted of three growth cycles using Apogee wheat. The third chamber was dedicated to the TVT study for the first growth cycle and used Apogee wheat. For the subsequent two wheat growth cycles, the third chamber was used for the PESTO study. For the first growth cycle in all Plant Growth Chambers, seeds were germinated pre-launch. In PESTO, the ages of the plants were staggered at launch so that comparisons of physiological and biochemical properties between mature plants, which were well developed and photosynthetically competent, and young plants could be studied. In-flight, plants were harvested at a specific age, and the initiation of the next cycle of growth was staggered between the chambers\n",

      "The Virgin Galactic Unity 22 mission conducted the first astronaut-manipulated suborbital spaceflight experiment. The experiment examined the operationalization of Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) as a generalizable approach to preserving biology at various phases of suborbital flight. The biology chosen for this experiment was Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0, because of the plant’s history of spaceflight experimentation within KFTs and wealth of comparative data from orbital experiments. KFTs were deployed as a wearable device, a leg pouch attached to the astronaut, which proved to be operationally effective during the course of the flight. Data from the inflight samples indicated that the microgravity period of the flight elicited the strongest transcriptomic responses as measured by the number of genes showing differential expression. Genes related to reactive oxygen species and stress, as well as genes associated with orbital spaceflight, were highly represented among the suborbital gene expression profile. In addition, gene families largely unaffected in orbital spaceflight were diversely regulated in suborbital flight, including stress-responsive transcription factors. The human-tended suborbital experiment demonstrated the operational effectiveness of the KFTs in suborbital flight and suggests that rapid transcriptomic responses are a part of the temporal dynamics at the beginning of physiological adaptation to spaceflight.\n",

      "The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 - Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EpEx) experiment onboard the International Space Station examined the spaceflight-altered cytosine methylation in two genetic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, wild-type Col-0 and the mutant elp2-5, which is deficient in an epigenetic regulator Elongator Complex Subunit 2 (ELP2). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) revealed distinct spaceflight associated methylation differences, presenting the need to explore specific space-altered methylation at single-molecule resolution to associate specific changes over large regions of spaceflight related genes. To date, tools of multiplexed targeted DNA methylation sequencing remain limited for plant genomes. This data set includes single-molecule profiling in user-defined targets using Flap-Enabled Next-Generation Capture (FENGC) on Arabidopsis root tissues to reveal precise modification of DNA methylation regulated by Elongator Complex Subunit 2 during spaceflight.\n",

      "Microorganisms' natural ability to live as organized multicellular communities – also known as biofilms – provides them with unique survival advantages. For instance, biofilms are protected against environmental stresses thanks to their extracellular matrix, which could contribute to persistent infections after treatment. Biofilms are also capable of strongly attaching to surfaces, where their metabolism byproducts could lead to surface material degradation. Furthermore, microgravity can alter biofilm behavior in unexpected ways, making the presence of biofilms in space a risk for both astronauts and spaceflight hardware. Despite the efforts to eliminate microorganism contamination from spacecrafts surfaces, it is impossible to prevent human-associated bacteria or fugus from eventually establishing biofilm surface colonization. Nevertheless, by understanding the changes that biofilms undergo in microgravity, it is possible to identify key differences and pathways that could be targeted to significantly reduce biofilm formation. The Space Biofilms project, performed at the International Space Station, contributes to such understanding by characterizing the morphology and gene expression of bacterial and fungal biofilms formed in microgravity with respect to ground controls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as model organism for the bacterial morphology and transcriptomic studies, while Penicillium rubens was used for the fungal morphology study. The data presented on this study page represent the morphology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the confocal microscopy assay.\n",

      "The cardiovascular system is strongly impacted by the hazards of spaceflight. Astronauts spending steadily increasing lengths of time in microgravity are subject to cardiovascular deconditioning resulting in loss of vascular tone, reduced total blood volume, and diminished cardiac output. Appreciating the mechanisms by which the cells of the vasculature are altered during spaceflight will be integral to understanding and combating these deleterious effects as the human presence in space advances. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis coupled with review by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software on human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) cultured for 3 days in microgravity and aboard the International Space Station to assess the transcriptomic changes that occur during spaceflight. The results of our RNA-Seq analysis show that SMCs undergo a wide range of transcriptional alteration while in space, significantly affecting 4,422 genes. SMCs largely down-regulate markers of the contractile, synthetic, and osteogenic phenotypes including smooth muscle alpha actin (αSMA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Additionally, components of several cellular signaling pathways were strongly impacted including the STAT3, NFκB, PI3K/AKT, HIF1α, and Endothelin pathways. This study highlights the significant changes in transcriptional behavior SMCs exhibit during spaceflight and puts these changes in context to better understand vascular function in space.\n",

      "Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6‐month‐old female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the flow cytometry assay using blood samples from same source animals used for behavioral studies in OSD-618.\n",

      "Gonadal hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, modulate muscle size and strength in males and females. However, the influence of sex hormones on muscle strength in micro- and partial-gravity environments (e.g., the Moon or Mars) is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of gonadectomy (castration/ovariectomy) on progression of muscle atrophy in both micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fischer rats (n equals 120) underwent castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham surgery (SHAM) at 11 weeks of age. After 2 weeks of recovery, rats were exposed to hindlimb unloading (0g), partial weight bearing at 40% of normal loading (0.4g, Martian gravity), or normal loading (1.0g) for 28 days. In males, CAST did not exacerbate body weight loss or other metrics of musculoskeletal health. In females, OVX animals tended to have greater body weight loss and greater gastrocnemius loss. Within 7 days of exposure to either microgravity or partial gravity, females had detectable changes to estrous cycle, with greater time spent in low-estradiol phases diestrus and metestrus (∼47% in 1g vs. 58% in 0g and 72% in 0.4g animals, P equals 0.005). We conclude that in males testosterone deficiency at the initiation of unloading has little effect on the trajectory of muscle loss. In females, initial low estradiol status may result in greater musculoskeletal losses. This study derives results from Grip (Force Transducer).\n",

      "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research missions RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA and micro computed tomography assays using tibia tissue from the RR9 mission and hindlimb unloaded/suspended (HLU/HLS) animals. The tibia data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-660 (Tibialis Anterior), OSD-661 (Lumbar Spine), OSD-662 (Soleus), OSD-663 (Femur), and OSD-664 (Extensor Digitorum Longus).\n",

      "The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included urine from pre-flight and post-flight/recovery timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82). 203 inflammatory, cytokine, and chemokine proteins were quantified using NULISAseq. This study derives results from the Multiplex assay, and the urine data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-569 (whole blood), OSD-570 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), OSD-571 (plasma), OSD-572 (skin, oral, and nasal swabs), OSD-573 (Dragon capsule samples), OSD-574 (skin biopsy), OSD-575 (serum), and OSD-630 (stool).\n",

      "This study's objective was to develop an understanding of the biological effects of space radiation on plants with the goal of producing fresh food during long duration space missions to support astronauts' nutritional and psychological needs.10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were exposed to simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and assessed for transcriptomic changes. The simulated GCR irradiation was carried out in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). The exposures were conducted acutely for two dose points at 40 cGy or 80 cGy, with sequential delivery of proton, helium, oxygen, silicon, and iron ions. Control and irradiated seedlings were then harvested and stabilized in RNAlater at 3 hrs. post irradiation. Total RNA was isolated for transcriptomic analyses using RNAseq. The data revealed that the transcriptomic responses were dose-dependent, with significant upregulation of DNA repair pathways and downregulation of glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways. Glucosinolates are important for plant pathogen defense and for the taste of a plant, which are both relevant to growing plants for spaceflight. These findings fill in knowledge gaps of how plants respond to radiation in beyond-Earth environments.\n",

      "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Western blot assay using tibialis anterior tissue from the RR9 mission. The tibialis anterior data in this study are related to other studies using tissues from the same experiment; OSD-654 (tibia), OSD-661 (lumbar spine), OSD-662 (soleus), OSD-663 (femur), and OSD-664 (extensor digitorum longus).\n",

At 7 days before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection with a bone formation marker (Calcein). At 48 +/- 2 hours before euthanasia, all 20 mice received an IP injection with a second dose of Calcein as well as a cell proliferation marker (BrdU). Then, following 28-29 days in microgravity, the Flight mice were euthanized. Following removal of hindlimbs, carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, preserved in the CryoChiller, and stored at -80 C or colder until return to Earth. In addition to the Flight group, three ground control groups were also part of the study: Basal (representing the pre-launch state), Vivarium (standard vivarium housing for the same duration of time as flight), and Ground (flight habitat in the International Space Station Environment Simulator, ISSES). Twenty mice (10 of each strain) were included in each of these control groups (except Vivarium which included 12 of each strain). These were treated, euthanized and processed on the same schedule and in the same manner as the flight samples.

      "Human expansion into the solar system is currently at the forefront of space research. For our astronauts to survive, they will need to be fed a healthy and nutritious diet on a consistent basis. Right now, our current method of feeding astronauts consists of resupplied prepackaged food from Earth, which is unsustainable for long-term missions. Using planetary resources via in situ resource utilization to grow crops is the next step toward sustainability in space. Asteroids are an abundant space resource and should not be overlooked when considering crewed missions. In particular, the primordial CI carbonaceous asteroids are of interest because the regolith is suggested to contain soluble elemental nutrients, such as phosphorous and potassium, that crops can use for growth and development. We present a study on the ability of CI carbonaceous asteroid regolith simulant to sustain plant growth of lettuce (Latuca sativa), radishes (Raphanus sativus), and peppers (Capsicum annuum). We tested growing the selected crops in increasing mixtures of simulant and peat moss. The results showed that each species reacted differently to each treatment and that the radishes were more affected by the treatments. Subsequent analysis showed that the simulant contains small amounts of plant-usable nutrients, despite its high pH, low cation exchange capacity, and classification as a silt-based soil. Our results indicate that the simulant is prone to compaction and crusting, leading to drought stress on the crops. Further investigations are needed to determine mitigation strategies to make CI asteroid regolith a more conducive soil. This data set derives results from the Image Analysis Photography assay with leaf area measurements. Additional data provided in the sample table includes plant height and biomass measurements as well as a thorough analysis of the substrate including pH, elemental analysis, and soil texture analysis.\n",

      "The Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions (CARA) spaceflight experiment provides comparative transcriptome analyses of plants grown in both light and dark conditions within the same spaceflight. CARA compared three genotypes of Arabidopsis grown in ambient light and in the dark on board the International Space Station (ISS); Col-0, Ws, and phyD, a phytochrome D mutant in the Col-0 background. In all genotypes, leaves responded to spaceflight with a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than root tips, and each genotype displayed distinct light / dark transcriptomic patterns that were unique to the spaceflight environment. The Col-0 leaves exhibited a substantial dichotomy, with ten-times as many spaceflight DEGs exhibited in light-grown plants versus dark-grown plants. Although the total number of DEGs in phyD leaves is not very different from Col-0, phyD altered the manner in which light-grown leaves respond to spaceflight, and many genes associated with the physiological adaptation of Col-0 to spaceflight were not represented. This result is in contrast to root tips, where a previous CARA study showed that phyD substantially reduced the number of DEGs. There were few DEGs, but a series of space-altered gene categories, common to genotypes and lighting conditions. This commonality indicates that key spaceflight genes are associated with signal transduction for light, defense, and oxidative stress responses. However, these key signaling pathways enriched from DEGs showed opposite regulatory direction in response to spaceflight under light and dark conditions, suggesting a complex interaction between light as a signal, and light-signaling genes in acclimation to spaceflight.\n",

      "This ground-based program was intended to address the etiology of visual system structural and functional changes observed in astronauts during both inflight and postflight periods. Using the well-documented rat hindlimb suspension (HLS) model, functionally equivalent to human head-down bedrest, we examined the relationship between cephalic fluid shifts resulting from long-duration G-unloading and the regulation of intracranial and intraocular pressures, as well as the effects these same cephalic fluid shifts have on visual system structure and function. Animals were chronically instrumented with biotelemetry to continuously measure intracranial pressure. Additionally, regular intraocular pressure measurements were made by tonometry during long-term exposure to cephalic fluid shifts induced by suspension. MRI images visualizing the visual system morphology were collected from HLS and control animals at regular intervals. Retinal morphology and ultrastructure were examined at specified intervals both during HLS and post-HLS recovery by ophthalmic examinations. This program utilized both male and female subjects in order to examine possible sex differences in these responses. We also examined the possible contributory factors of aging and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) on these responses of the visual system. Further, in addition to mimicking the effects of long duration exposure to microgravity through the use of the HLS model, we examined the responses of our measured outcomes during long-term recovery in the post-HLS period. Collectively, these data will help us to develop a model to both understand and predict the etiology of changes in visual structure and function in astronauts exposed to the microgravity of spaceflight and during postflight recovery. This study investigated the development of a translational mammalian model within the context of hindlimb unloading, sex, and aging by which the data generated using this model can facilitate the development of countermeasures to alleviate any visual system decrements arising from exposure to the microgravity spaceflight environment. This study derives results from Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Optical Coherence Tomography, Tonometry, and A-scan Ultrasonography assays using eye tissues. This study is related to results found in OSD-680 (optic nerve) and OSD-681(subcutaneous tissue and subdural space).\n",

      "The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of cornu ammonis 1 region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-685 (dentate gyrus), OSD-698 (frontal cortex), and OSD-699 (cerebral cortex).\n",

      "Staphylococcus aureus is commonly isolated from astronauts returning from spaceflight missions. Previous analysis of BRIC-23 omics data generated from S. aureus low Earth orbit cultures indicated significantly increased expression of the Agr quorum sensing system and its downstream targets in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls. In this current study, the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) was used to investigate the effect of low shear modelled microgravity (LSMMG) on S. aureus physiology and Agr activity. When cultured in BRIC-23 medium and temperature conditions, S. aureus LSMMG cultures exhibited decreased agr expression and altered growth compared to normal gravity control cultures, which are typically oriented with gas permeable membrane on bottom of the high aspect rotating vessel (HARV). However, when grown in an inverted gravity control orientation (membrane on top of the HARV), reduced Agr activity was observed relative to both traditional control and LSMMG cultures, signifying that oxygen availability may affect the observed differences in agr expression. Metabolite assays revealed increased lactate and decreased acetate excretion in both LSMMG and inverted control cultures. Secretomics analysis of LSMMG, control, and inverted control HARV culture supernatants corroborated these results, with inverted and LSMMG cultures exhibiting decreased abundance of Agr-regulated virulence factors and increased abundance of low-oxygen metabolic proteins. Collectively, these studies suggest that orientation of the HARV gas permeable membrane can affect S. aureus physiology and Agr quorum sensing in the RCCS, a variable that should be considered when interpreting data using this ground-based microgravity model.\n",

      "Microphysiological systems provide the opportunity to model accelerated changes at the human tissue level in the extreme space environment. Spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts shares similar physiological changes to muscle wasting in older adults, known as sarcopenia. These shared attributes provide a rationale for investigating molecular changes in muscle cells exposed to spaceflight that may mimic the underlying pathophysiology of sarcopenia. We report the results from three-dimensional myobundles derived from muscle biopsies from young and older adults, integrated into an autonomous CubeLab™, and flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX CRS-21 as part of the NIH/NASA funded Tissue Chips in Space program. Global transcriptomic RNA-Seq analyses comparing the myobundles in space and on the ground revealed downregulation of shared transcripts related to myoblast proliferation and muscle differentiation. The analyses also revealed downregulated differentially expressed gene pathways related to muscle metabolism unique to myobundles derived from the older cohort exposed to the space environment compared to ground controls. Gene classes related to inflammatory pathways were downregulated in flight samples cultured from the younger cohort compared to ground controls. Our muscle tissue chip platform provides an approach to studying the cell autonomous effects of spaceflight on muscle cell biology that may not be appreciated on the whole organ or organism level and sets the stage for continued data collection from muscle tissue chip experimentation in microgravity. We also report on the challenges and opportunities for conducting autonomous tissue-on-chip CubeLab™ payloads on the ISS.\n",

      "The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of dentate gyrus region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-682 (cornu ammonis 1), OSD-698 (frontal cortex), and OSD-699 (cerebral cortex).\n",

      "Spaceflight induces hepatic damage, partially owing to oxidative stress caused by the space environment such as microgravity and space radiation. We examined the roles of anti-oxidative sulfur-containing compounds on hepatic damage after spaceflight. We analyzed the livers of mice on board the International Space Station for 30 days. During spaceflight, half of the mice were exposed to artificial earth gravity (1 g) using centrifugation cages. Sulfur-metabolomics of the livers of mice after spaceflight revealed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants (ergothioneine, glutathione, cysteine, taurine, thiamine, etc.) and their intermediates (cysteine sulfonic acid, hercynine, N-acethylserine, serine, etc.) compared to the controls on the ground. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing showed upregulation of gene sets related to oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism, and downregulation of gene sets related to glutathione reducibility in the livers of mice after spaceflight, compared to controls on the ground. These changes were partially mitigated by exposure to 1 g centrifugation. For the first time, we observed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants based on a comprehensive analysis of the livers of mice after spaceflight. Our data suggest that a decrease in sulfur-containing compounds owing to both microgravity and other spaceflight environments (radiation and stressors) contributes to liver damage after spaceflight.\n",

      "Spaceflight-related stresses impact health via various body systems, including the haematopoietic and immune systems, with effects ranging from moderate alterations of homoeostasis to serious illness. Oxidative stress appears to be involved in these changes, and the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates expression of a set of cytoprotective and antioxidative stress response genes, has been implicated in the response to spaceflight-induced stresses. Here, we show through analyses of mice from the MHU-3 project, in which Nrf2-knockout mice travelled in space for 31 days, that mice lacking Nrf2 suffer more seriously from spaceflight-induced immunosuppression than wild-type mice. We discovered that a one-month spaceflight-triggered the expression of tissue inflammatory marker genes in wild-type mice, an effect that was even more pronounced in the absence of Nrf2. Concomitant with induction of inflammatory conditions, the consumption of coagulation-fibrinolytic factors and platelets was elevated by spaceflight and further accelerated by Nrf2 deficiency. These results highlight that Nrf2 mitigates spaceflight-induced inflammation, subsequent immunosuppression, and thrombotic microangiopathy. These observations reveal a new strategy to relieve health problems encountered during spaceflight.\n",

      "Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of spaceflown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with antioxidant treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak. This study derives results from the Western Blot and ATPase Assays using soleus tissue from the RR-18 mission.\n",

      "On Earth, people spend 90% of their time indoors where dust and moisture can facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially fungi. The International Space Station is a specialized closed environment that contains own unique indoor microbiome. Elevated moisture such as from a temporary ventilation system malfunction may lead to unintended microbial growth indoors, which is associated with negative health outcomes and degradation of essential built environment materials. We need to develop a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth to understand when it may occur in these critical indoor spaces. Here we demonstrate that exposure to even fluctuating elevated relative humidity above 80% can lead to rapid microbial growth and community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We were able to model fungal growth in space station dust using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions, respectively. Alpha and beta diversity of fungi was altered with both significantly decreasing as relative humidity and time elevated increased. Our results demonstrate that we can use moisture conditions to develop predictive models for fungal growth and composition. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can protect astronaut health, spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.\n",

Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of cerebral cortex region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-682 (cornu ammonis 1), OSD-685 (dentate gyrus), and OSD-698 (frontal cortex).\n",

      "Microbes are present in all occupied indoor environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). An unexpected ventilation system failure may lead to microbial and fungal growth that is associated with material degradation or negative health effects. There is a need for improved understanding of fungal function when exposed to moisture in indoor spaces. A de novo metatranscriptomic study was performed using dust collected from within the ISS. After returning to Earth, dust was incubated in laboratory chambers to simulate relative humidity conditions of 50%, 85%, or 100% equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) for 1-week. Changes in fungal function (gene expression) were associated with moisture exposure. Genes associated with secondary metabolism and fungal growth were significantly upregulated (p ≤ 0.001, log2FC ≥ 2) at elevated RH conditions (85% or 100% ERH). Elevated moisture conditions showed an increased expression of mycotoxin and fungal allergen genes such as Asp f 4 and Alt a 7 (log2FC ≥ 5). These results demonstrate that understanding microbial gene expression in response to elevated moisture will help improve microbial monitoring standards for confined spacecraft environments and help protect astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.\n",

      "Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue and plays a crucial role in elasticity, stability, and force distribution. While the adaptations of tendon to internal stimuli have been extensively researched, the impact of environmental factors (such as microgravity) on its structure and function at the nanoscopic scale (i.e., fibril level) remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 32 days (d) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on murine tendon collagen fibril morphology and nanomechanics (Young’s Modulus, YM). Quadriceps tendon samples from 16wk old female C57BL/6J mice aboard NASA Rodent Research-1 underwent chemical processing and mechanical isolation. Subsequently, collagen fibrils (n equals 38) were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard 4a) to compare the morphology (diameter, height) and nanomechanics (average YM) between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) mouse tendon samples. The qp-BioAC-CB1 cantilever (spring constant: 0.3 N/m, tip radius: 10µm) was used under quantitative imaging mode (Qi) for all force and morphological measurements. The data from 17 micrographs (SF n equals 23; GC n equals 15) was processed via the JPK Data Processing Software (Version 6.4.5.), and finally analyzed via Gwyddion (Version 2.62). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use AFM QI-mode on tendon collagen fibrils after spaceflight. Mean fibril size and YM were similar between SF and GC mouse tendon fibrils after 32 days of space flight; these results suggest that collagen fibrils may require more time to adapt to changes in their environment, and/or more rapid changes may take place at different levels of the collagen hierarchy. This data provides valuable insights into mammalian tissue adaptations during spaceflight, and future research should continue these investigations with longer-duration missions to build a time-course of tendon adaptations to microgravity. All results derived are from atomic force microscopy using quadriceps femoris tendon tissue.\n",

      "Skeletal muscle is sensitive to gravitational alterations. We recently developed a multiple artificial-gravity research system (MARS), which can generate gravity ranging from microgravity to Earth gravity (1 g) in space. Using the MARS, we studied the effects of three different gravitational levels (microgravity, lunar gravity [1/6 g], and 1 g) on the skeletal muscle mass and myofiber constitution in mice. All mice survived and returned to Earth, and skeletal muscle was collected two days after landing. We observed that microgravity-induced soleus muscle atrophy was prevented by lunar gravity. However, lunar gravity failed to prevent the slow-to-fast myofiber transition in the soleus muscle in space. These results suggest that lunar gravity is enough to maintain proteostasis, but a greater gravitational force is required to prevent the myofiber type transition. Our study proposes that different gravitational thresholds may be required for skeletal muscle adaptation.\n",

      "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/- 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4-19.3 mmHg vs 16.3-20.3 mmHg) (p  less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p  less than  0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.\n",

      "Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue and plays a crucial role in elasticity, stability, and force distribution. While the adaptations of tendon to internal stimuli have been extensively researched, the impact of environmental factors (such as microgravity) on its structure and function at the nanoscopic scale (i.e., fibril level) remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 32 days (d) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on murine tendon collagen fibril morphology and nanomechanics (Young’s Modulus, YM). Gastronemius tendon samples from 16wk old female C57BL/6J mice aboard NASA Rodent Research-1 underwent chemical processing and mechanical isolation. Subsequently, collagen fibrils (n equals 17) were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard 4a) to compare the morphology (diameter, height) and nanomechanics (average YM) between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) mouse tendon samples. The qp-BioAC-CB1 cantilever (spring constant: 0.3 N/m, tip radius: 10µm) was used under quantitative imaging mode (Qi) for all force and morphological measurements. The data from 17 micrographs (SF n equals 5; GC n equals 12) was processed via the JPK Data Processing Software (Version 6.4.5.), and finally analyzed via Gwyddion (Version 2.62). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use AFM QI-mode on tendon collagen fibrils after spaceflight. Mean fibril size and YM were similar between Space Flight (SF) and Ground Control (GC) mouse tendon fibrils after 32 days of space flight; these results suggest that collagen fibrils may require more time to adapt to changes in their environment, and/or more rapid changes may take place at different levels of the collagen hierarchy. This data provides valuable insights into mammalian tissue adaptations during spaceflight, and future research should continue these investigations with longer-duration missions to build a time-course of tendon adaptations to microgravity. This dataset includes results from atomic force microscopy using gastronemius tendon tissue.\n",

      "Exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation is an innate risk of the spaceflight environment that can cause DNA damage and altered cellular function. In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-exposure for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions. This study includes data from blood samples only.\n",

      "Space irradiation (IR) is an important health risk for deep-space missions. We reported heart failure with preserved ejection fraction like cardiac phenotype 660-days following exposure to a single-dose of a simplified galactic cosmic ray simulation (simGCRsim) only in males with functional and structural impairment in left ventricular (LV) function. This sex-based dichotomy prompted us to investigate sex-specific changes in the LV transcriptome in three-month-old male and female mice exposed to 137Cs-gamma- or simGCRsim-IR. Non-IR male and female (10 each) mice served as controls. LVs were collected at 440/660- and 440/550-days post-IR, male and female, respectively. RNA sequencing, differential gene expression, and functional annotation were performed on tissues from 5 mice/group. Sex and post-IR time points had the greatest influence on gene expression, surpassing the IR-type effects. SimGCRsim-IR showed more persistent transcriptome changes than gamma-IR. We suggest that the single IR effects can persist up to 550–660 days, with overwhelmingly sex-biased responses at individual gene expression level.\n",

      "The innate immune response is the first line of defense for all animals to not only detect invading microbes and toxins but also sense and interface with the environment. One such environment that can significantly affect innate immunity is spaceflight. In this study, we explored the impact of microgravity stress on key elements of the NFκB innate immune pathway. The symbiosis between the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri was used as a model system under a simulated microgravity environment. The expression of genes associated with the NFκB pathway was monitored over time as the symbiosis progressed. Results revealed that although the onset of the symbiosis was the major driver in the differential expression of NFκB signaling, the stress of simulated low-shear microgravity also caused a dysregulation of expression. Several genes were expressed at earlier time points suggesting that elements of the E. scolopes NFκB pathway are stress-inducible, whereas expression of other pathway components was delayed. The results provide new insights into the role of NFκB signaling in the squid-vibrio symbiosis, and how the stress of microgravity negatively impacts the host immune response. Together, these results provide a foundation to develop mitigation strategies to maintain host-microbe homeostasis during spaceflight.\n",

      "Ionic silver (Ag+) is being investigated as a residual biocide for use in NASA spacecraft potable water systems on future crewed missions. This water will be used to irrigate future spaceflight crop production systems. We have evaluated the impact of three concentrations (31 ppb, 125 ppb, and 500 ppb) of ionic silver biocide solutions on lettuce in an arcillite (calcinated clay particle substrate) and hydroponic (substrate-less) growth setup after 28 days. Lettuce plant growth was reduced in the hydroponic samples treated with 31 ppb silver and severely stunted for samples treated at 125 ppb and 500 ppb silver. No growth defects were observed in arcillite-grown lettuce. Silver was detectable in the hydroponic-grown lettuce leaves at each concentration but was not detected in the arcillite-grown lettuce leaves. Specifically, when 125 ppb silver water was applied to a hydroponics tray, Ag+ was detected at an average amount of 7 ug/g (dry weight) in lettuce leaves. The increase in Ag+ corresponded with a decrease in several essential elements in the lettuce tissue (Ca, K, P, S). In the arcillite growth setup, silver did not impact the plant root zone microbiome in terms of alpha diversity and relative abundance between treatments and control. However, with increasing silver concentration, the alpha diversity increased in lettuce root samples and in the water from the hydroponics tray samples. The genera in the hydroponic root and water samples were similar across the silver concentrations but displayed different relative abundances. This suggests that ionic silver was acting as a selective pressure for the microbes that colonize the hydroponic water. The surviving microbes likely utilized exudates from the stunted plant roots as a carbon source. Analysis of the root-associated microbiomes in response to silver showed enrichment of metagenomic pathways associated with alternate carbon source utilization, fatty-acid synthesis, and the ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) stringent response global regulatory system that operates under conditions of environmental stress. Nutrient solutions containing Ag+ in concentrations greater than 31 ppb in hydroponic systems lacking cation-exchange capacity can severely impact crop production due to stunting of plant growth.\n",

      "Investigating the evolution of Escherichia coli in microgravity offers valuable insights into microbial adaptation to extreme environments. Here the effects of simulated microgravity (SµG) on gene expression and genome evolution of E. coli REL606, a strain evolved terrestrially for 35 years, is explored. The transcriptomic changes for glucose-limited and glucose-replete conditions over 24 h illustrate that SµG increased the expression of genes involved in stress response, biofilm, and metabolism. A greater number of differentially expressed genes related to the general stress response (GSR) and biofilm formation is observed in simulated microgravity cultures under glucose-limited conditions in comparison to glucose-replete conditions. Longer term SµG culture under glucose-limited conditions led to the accumulation of unique mutations when compared to control cultures, particularly in the mraZ/fruR intergenic region and the elyC gene, suggesting changes in peptidoglycan and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) production. These findings highlight the physiological and genomic adaptations of E. coli to microgravity, offering a foundation for future research into the long-term effects of space conditions on bacterial evolution.\n",

      "Space exploration exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from September 21st, 2014, to October 25th, 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice. This dataset derives results from the ECLIA and Western Blot assays using brain tissue.\n",

      "In Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (RRRM-1), forty female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. Feces were removed from 145 animals and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ˚C until DNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 10 M clusters per sample, PE 251 bp). This dataset features whole-genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from 8-10 feces samples per group.\n",

      "Space exploration exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from September 21st, 2014, to October 25th, 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice. This dataset derives results from the ECLIA assay using brain tissue.\n",

      "The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts that spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment, which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to restore partial or Earth-like gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1G, and then performed RNA-seq on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Adding artificial gravity on board the ISS can attenuate the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue. This study hosts retina data, and OSD-759 hosts optic nerve data.\n",

      "The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts that spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment, which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to restore partial or Earth-like gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0, 0.33, 0.67, and 1G, and then performed RNA-seq on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive.

      "The objective of the Rodent Research-23 mission (RR-23) was to better understand the effects of spaceflight on the eyes, specifically on the structure and function of the arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels that are needed to maintain vision. To this end, twenty male, C57BL/6J, 16-17 weeks-old mice were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-21 in a single transporter, transferred to two rodent habitats, and maintained in microgravity for 38 days. Flight mice were then returned to Earth alive (January 13th, 2021). After splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean, mice were transported to Kennedy Space Center via helicopter. The 20 Flight (FLT), 20 Habitat Ground Control (GC), and 20 Vivarium Ground Control (VIV) mice were removed from Rodent Transporters (FLT and GC) or vivarium cages (VIV), placed into shipping containers, and flown to Texas A and M University. There, mice underwent post-flight procedures, before euthanasia and tissue collection. FLT, GC and VIV animals were euthanized and dissected on Jan 14th, 17th or 20th of 2021, respectively. Soleus muscle samples were preserved by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until RNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 60 M clusters per sample, PE 149 bp). This dataset features 9 samples from the Flight group, 9 samples from the Habitat Ground Control group, and 9 samples from the Vivarium Ground Control group.\n",

      "In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-2), forty female C57BL/6NTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 12 week-old and twenty 29 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 55-58 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 32 days and allowed to recover for 24 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. ISS-T and LAR mice were the same age at sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice per group housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice per group sacrificed 2 days before launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice per group housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-2 included a total of 160 mice. This study includes bulk RNA sequencing ribodepleted gene expression data from the kidneys from 5 old and 5 young animals from each of the following groups: LAR basal (BSL), LAR ground control (GC), LAR vivarium control (VIV), LAR flight (FLT), ISS-T basal (BSL), ISS-T ground control (GC), ISS-T vivarium control (VIV), and ISS-T flight (FLT).\n",

      "Growing plants in spaceflight presents challenges to achieve optimal plant growth and productivity. One of NASA's goals is growing edible crops in spaceflight to supplement the astronauts' diet with fresh vegetables and assess food safety of the crops. It is important to understand the optimal growing conditions for crops grown in spaceflight conditions. Leafy greens have been grown on the International Space Station in the Veggie plant chamber and were safe for the astronauts to eat. The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH), an enclosed, controlled plant growth facility on the ISS has also been used to grow edible plants. The technology demonstration in the APH grew chile peppers, Capsicum annum c.v. NuMex Espanola Improved. This was one of the longest continuous plant growth experiments conducted on ISS (137 days), producing 26 pepper fruit.\n",

Using multivariate principal components analysis, we found sex dimorphic responses in mice exposed to accelerated charged particles to simulate GCR (GCRsim); males displayed impaired spatial learning, whereas females did not. Mechanistically, these GCRsim induced learning impairments corresponded with chronic microglia activation and synaptic alterations in the hippocampus. Temporary microglia depletion shortly after GCRsim exposure mitigated GCRsim induced deficits measured months after the radiation exposure. Furthermore, blood monocyte levels measured early after GCRsim exposure were predictive of the late learning deficits and microglia activation measured in the male mice. Our findings (i) advance our understanding of charged particle induced cognitive challenges, (ii) provide evidence for early peripheral biomarkers for identifying late cognitive deficits, and (iii) offer potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating GCR induced cognitive loss.

      "Microgravity has been shown to lead to both muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration. The purpose was to study the efficacy of microgravity to model impaired muscle regeneration in an engineered muscle platform and then to demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug screening in this model. Engineered human muscle was launched to the International Space Station National Laboratory, where the effect of microgravity exposure for 7 days was examined by transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Gene set enrichment analysis of engineered muscle cultured in microgravity, compared to normal gravity conditions, highlighted a metabolic shift toward lipid and fatty acid metabolism, along with increased apoptotic gene expression. The addition of pro-regenerative drugs, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor (15-PGDH-i), partially inhibited the effects of microgravity. In summary, microgravity mimics aspects of impaired myogenesis, and the addition of these drugs could partially inhibit the effects induced by microgravity. Only data for myoblast samples are reported here. See OSD-787 for vastus lateralis tissue data.\n",

      "There is increasing interest in the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) on plants as might occur during spaceflight, or as a consequence of human activities, such as nuclear power generation, that may result in the release of radioactive materials into the environment. High doses of IR have long been used for the induction of mutations in plants with the goal of generating desirable traits for agribusiness. However, less is known about the responses of plants to acute low doses of IR exposure. Here, we take a multi-omics approach to characterize the response to low dose IR in A. thaliana. We adapt the Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates (MAPit) technique for use in plants allowing us to assay the epigenetic response to acute low-dose IR (10 cGy and 100 cGy) 72 hr after exposure, and, in parallel, use RNA sequencing to profile the transcription response at 1, 3, 24 and 72 hr after exposure. We observe that IR exposures as low as 10 cGy elicit robust genetic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana detectable as early as 1 hr after exposure. Examination of these responses revealed dose-dependent changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation that implicate the ethylene signalling pathway and response to abiotic stress as underlying the transcriptional and epigenetic changes associated with IR. These changes are observable up to 72 hr after exposure suggesting that they are maintained well after the initial acute exposure. Our findings indicate that A. thaliana executes a coordinated, multi-modal response to low-dose IR through induction and regulation of the ethylene response pathway.\n",

      "Low-intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is often used as an alternative to exercise and high-intensity electrical stimulation to prevent the loss of muscle mass, strength, and endurance in spaceflight and in patients with severe chronic diseases. This study assessed the efficiency of low-intensity (~10% of maximal voluntary contraction) combined (low- and high-frequency) electrical stimulation in preventing the negative effects of weekly disuse (dry immersion without [DI, see a related dataset GSE271607] and with [DI+NMES] daily stimulation; 10 males in each group) on the strength and aerobic performance of the ankle plantar flexors and knee extensors, mitochondrial function in permeabilized muscle fibers, and the proteomic (quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis) and transcriptomic (RNA-sequencing) profiles of the soleus muscle and vastus lateralis muscle. Application of electrical stimulation during dry immersion prevented a decrease in the maximal strength and a slight reduction in aerobic performance of knee extensors, as well as a decrease in maximal ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration and changes in the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial, extracellular matrix, and membrane proteins in the vastus lateralis muscle. In contrast, for the ankle plantar flexors/soleus muscle, electrical stimulation had a positive effect only on maximal mitochondrial respiration, but accelerated the decline in the maximal strength and muscle fiber cross-sectional area, which appears to be associated with the activation of genes regulating the inflammatory response. The data obtained open up broad prospects for the use of low-intensity combined electrical stimulation to prevent the negative effects of disuse for “mixed” muscles, meanwhile, the optimization of the stimulation protocol is required for “slow” muscles. Only data for soleus tissue samples are reported here. See OSD-784 for vastus lateralis tissue data.\n",

      "Microgravity has been shown to lead to both muscle atrophy and impaired muscle regeneration. The purpose was to study the efficacy of microgravity to model impaired muscle regeneration in an engineered muscle platform and then to demonstrate the feasibility of performing drug screening in this model. Engineered human muscle was launched to the International Space Station National Laboratory, where the effect of microgravity exposure for 7 days was examined by transcriptomics and proteomics approaches. Gene set enrichment analysis of engineered muscle cultured in microgravity, compared to normal gravity conditions, highlighted a metabolic shift toward lipid and fatty acid metabolism, along with increased apoptotic gene expression. The addition of pro-regenerative drugs, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase inhibitor (15-PGDH-i), partially inhibited the effects of microgravity. In summary, microgravity mimics aspects of impaired myogenesis, and the addition of these drugs could partially inhibit the effects induced by microgravity. Only data for vastus lateralis tissue samples are reported here. See OSD-781 for myoblast data.\n",

      "The proteomics experiment involved analyzing the protein expression profiles of Enterobacter cloacae under different gravity conditions simulated in High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs). The three conditions studied were normal gravity (NG), inverted normal gravity (INV), and low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). The goal was to assess how E. cloacae adapts to microgravity, given its relevance to astronaut health during spaceflight. By comparing the proteomic profiles across these conditions, the study identified significant changes in protein expression in LSMMG and INV compared to NG.\n",

      "Purpose: Space exploration poses unique challenges to astronauts, especially the effects of space radiation and microgravity (uG). Understanding molecular responses to these factors is crucial for ensuring astronaut health, and this study aimed to identify transcriptomic changes in mouse hypothalamic cell line N38 (mHypoE-N38) caused by simulated space environments. Method: Four experimental groups were established, namely, a ground condition group (GC; the control group), a proton irradiated group (the space radiation group), a simulated uG group, and a proton irradiated × simulated uG group (the combination group). RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to investigate key altered genes and to validate them. Results: Three hundred and fifty-five differentially expressed genes were identified. Notably, the expressions of UCN2 and UGT1A5 genes were upregulated in all three experimental groups, suggesting a shared regulatory mechanism with potential consequences for brain function during space missions. Moreover, the study revealed significant alterations in genes belonging to the USP17 and ZSCAN4 families, indicating active response to DNA damage and telomere maintenance. PCR results validated that UGT1A5, USP17 family, and ZSCAN4 families (ZSCAN4C, ZSCAN4D, and ZSCAN4F) were significantly upregulated at the mRNA level in the combination group, while UCN2, ZSCAN4A, and ZSCAN4B were not reproduced. Conclusion: The present study on mHypoE-N38 cells exposed to space environments revealed a complex molecular narrative with disease-oriented implications. The knowledge gained might serve as a cornerstone for developing strategies to mitigate potential health risks associated with extended exposure to space-related stressors.\n",

      "Genomic plasticity helps adapt to extreme environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to space environment (ESE) impacts the epigenome inducing genomic plasticity. Murine skin samples from the Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 were procured from the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory. Targeted RNA sequencing to test differential gene expression between the skin of ESE versus ground controls revealed upregulation of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis pathways secondary to promoter hypomethylation in responders. Methylome sequencing identified ESE-sensitive hypomethylated genes including developmental angiogenic genes Araf, Vegfb, and Vegfr1. Based on differentially expressed genes, the angiogenesis biofunction was enriched in responders. The induction of genomic plasticity in response to ESE, as reported herein, may be viewed as a mark of biological resilience that is evident in a minority of organisms, responders but not in non-responders, exposed to the same stressor. Inducible genomic plasticity may be implicated in natural resilience to ESE. GeneLab Note: at the time of releasing this dataset, the associated publication has a typo throughout where RRRM-1 samples are incorrectly said to be flown on SpaceX-19 (should be SpaceX-16). The corresponding authors were contacted and it was verified to be an error. They have alerted the publisher of the error and will be making a correction to the publication at some point. As a result, all information in the present study has been curated using the correct mission record for the RRRM-1 payload (SpaceX-16).\n",

      "Background: Crewed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions to other solar system bodies are currently being planned. One high-profile scientific focus during such expeditions would be life detection, specifically the discovery of past or present microbial life, if they exist. However, both humans and associated objects typically carry a high microbial burden. Thus, it is essential to distinguish between microbes brought with the expedition and those present on the exploring planets. Modern spacesuits are unique, customized spacecraft which provide protection, mobility and life support to crew during spacewalks, yet they vent, and the mobility of microbes through spacesuits has not been studied. Results:To evaluate the microbial colonization of spacesuits, NASA used an Extravehicular Activity swab kit to examine viable microbial populations of 48 samples from spacesuits using both traditional microbiological methods and molecular sequencing methods. The cultivable microbial population ranged from below the detection limit to 9 × 10^2 colony forming units per 25 cm^2 of sample and also significantly varied by the location. The cultivable microbial diversity was dominated by members of Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Ascomycota. However, 16S rRNA-based viable bacterial burden ranged from 10^5 to 10^6 copies per 25 cm^2 of sample. Shotgun metagenome sequencing revealed the presence of a diverse microbial population on the spacesuit surfaces, including Curtobacterium and Methylobacterium from across all sets of spacesuits in high abundance. Among bacterial species identified, higher abundance of Cutibacterium acnes, Methylobacterium oryzae, and M. phyllosphaerae reads were documented. Conclusion:The results of this study provide evidence that identical microbial strains may live on the wrist joint, inner gauntlet, and outer gauntlet of spacesuits. This raises the possibility, but does not confirm that microbial contaminants on the outside of the suits could contaminate planetary science operations unless additional measures are taken. Overall, these data provide the first estimate of microbial distribution associated with spacesuit surfaces, which will help future mission planners develop effective planetary protection strategies.\n",

      "Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity. This study derives results from femur and vertebrae using the micro computed tomography assay.\n",

During an anomaly, an increase of carbon-to-nitrogen ratio led to a shift in the microbial community within PMBR photomembrane bioreactor (PMBR). It is imperative to understand failure modes of the system and the system’s ability to respond to perturbations in treatment because of their proposed application in remote, resource-limited locations. During this transient event, the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the AnMBR permeate increased from 0.341 to 11.2. Results showed that the microbial community became more diverse during the event and enriched in species related to the remediation of aromatic compounds. The community shift led to conditions required for greater than 90% carbon removal by the PMBR. The inclusion of the PMBR in the treatment architecture increased resilience and robustness for treating high-strength wastewaters in extreme environments.\n",

      "Exploiting the symbiotic interaction between crops and nitrogen-fixing bacteria is a simple and ecological method to promote plant growth in prospective extraterrestrial human outposts. In this study, we performed an RNA-seq analysis to investigate the adaptation of the legume symbiont Paraburkholderia phymatum STM815^T to simulated microgravity (s0-g) at the transcriptome level. The results revealed a drastic effect on gene expression, with roughly 23% of P. phymatum genes being differentially regulated in s0-g. Among those, 951 genes were upregulated and 858 downregulated in the cells grown in s0-g compared to terrestrial gravity (1 g). Several genes involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover or chaperones encoding were upregulated in s0-g, while those involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biosynthesis, motility or inorganic ions transport were downregulated. Specifically, the whole phm gene cluster, previously bioinformatically predicted to be involved in the production of a hypothetical malleobactin-like siderophore, phymabactin, was 20-fold downregulated in microgravity. By constructing a mutant strain (delta phmJK) we confirmed that the phm gene cluster codes for the only siderophore secreted by P. phymatum as assessed by the complete lack of iron chelating activity of the P. phymatum delta phmJK mutant on chrome azurol S (CAS) agar plates. These results not only provide a deeper understanding of the physiology of symbiotic organisms exposed to space-like conditions, but also increase our knowledge of iron acquisition mechanisms in rhizobia.\n",

      "Efficient generation of cardiomyocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is important for their application in basic and translational studies. Space microgravity can significantly change cell activities and function. Previously, we reported upregulation of genes associated with cardiac proliferation in cardiac progenitors derived from hiPSCs that were exposed to space microgravity for 3 days. Here we investigated the effect of long-term exposure of hiPSC-cardiac progenitors to space microgravity on global gene expression. Cryopreserved 3D hiPSC-cardiac progenitors were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) and cultured for 3 weeks under ISS microgravity and ISS 1 G conditions. RNA-sequencing analyses revealed upregulation of genes associated with cardiac differentiation, proliferation, and cardiac structure/function and downregulation of genes associated with extracellular matrix regulation in the ISS microgravity cultures compared with the ISS 1 G cultures. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes mapping identified the upregulation of biological processes, molecular function, cellular components, and pathways associated with cell cycle, cardiac differentiation, and cardiac function. Taking together, these results suggest that space microgravity has a beneficial effect on the differentiation and growth of cardiac progenitors.\n",

      "Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body's defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.\n",

      "The effects of galactic cosmic radiation on reproductive physiology remain largely unknown. We determined the impact of near-continuous low-dose-rate Californium-252 neutron irradiation (1 mGy/day) as a space-relevant analog on litter size and number of resorptions at embryonic day (E) 12.5 (n  equals 19 radiated dams, n  equals  20 controls) and litter size, number of resorptions, fetal growth, and placental signaling and transcriptome (RNA sequencing) at E18.5 (n  equals  21 radiated dams, n  equals  20 controls) in pregnant mice. A significantly increased early resorption rate and decreased placental weight were observed in irradiated mice. There were no statistically significant differences in litter size, fetal weight, length, or malformation rate between the groups. Near-continuous radiation had no significant effects on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), endoplasmic reticulum stress or inflammatory signaling, rate of double-stranded DNA breaks, and had minimal effects on gene expression in the placenta. These data suggest that near-continuous, low-level galactic cosmic radiation has a limited impact on pregnancy outcomes.\n",

      "A limitation of simulated space radiation studies is that radiation exposure is not the only environmental challenge astronauts face during missions. Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study contains plasma metabolomics data. The hippocampus metabolomics data are deposited in OSD-833, the cortex metabolomics data in OSD-834, and the behavioral assay data in OSD-835.\n",

Therefore, we characterized behavioral and cognitive performance of male WAG/Rij rats 3 months after sham-irradiation or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion mixed beam exposure in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) alone. Six months following behavioral and cognitive testing or 9 months following sham-irradiation or total body irradiation, plasma and brain tissues (hippocampus and cortex) were processed to determine whether the behavioral and cognitive effects were associated with long-term alterations in metabolic pathways in plasma and brain. Sham HU, but not irradiated HU, rats were impaired in spatial habituation learning. Rats irradiated with 1.5 Gy showed increased depressive-like behaviors. This was seen in the absence but not presence of HU. Thus, HU has differential effects in sham-irradiated and irradiated animals and specific behavioral measures are associated with plasma levels of distinct metabolites 6 months later. The combined effects of HU and radiation on metabolic pathways in plasma and brain illustrate the complex interaction of environmental stressors and highlights the importance of assessing these interactions. This study derives results from the Open Field, Novel Object Recognition and Forced Swim Test behavior assays.\n",

      "The space environment astronauts experience during space missions consists of multiple environmental challenges, including microgravity. In this study, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performances of male Fisher rats 2 months after sham irradiation or total body irradiation with photons in the absence or presence of simulated microgravity. We analyzed the plasma collected 9 months after sham irradiation or total body irradiation for distinct alterations in metabolic pathways and to determine whether changes to metabolic measures were associated with specific behavioral and cognitive measures. A total of 344 male Fischer rats were irradiated with photons (6 MeV; 3, 8, or 10 Gy) in the absence or presence of simulated weightlessness achieved using hindlimb unloading (HU). To identify potential plasma biomarkers of photon radiation exposure or the HU condition for behavioral or cognitive performance, we performed regression analyses. The behavioral effects of HU on activity levels in an open field, measures of anxiety in an elevated plus maze, and anhedonia in the MandM consumption test were more pronounced than those of photon irradiation. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism and biosynthesis showed very strong pathway changes, following photon irradiation and HU in animals irradiated with 3 Gy. Here, 29 out of 101 plasma metabolites were associated with 1 out of 13 behavioral measures. In the absence of HU, 22 metabolites were related to behavioral and cognitive measures. In HU animals that were sham-irradiated or irradiated with 8 Gy, one metabolite was related to behavioral and cognitive measures. In HU animals irradiated with 3 Gy, six metabolites were related to behavioral and cognitive measures. These data suggest that it will be possible to develop stable plasma biomarkers of behavioral and cognitive performance, following environmental challenges like HU and radiation exposure. This study derives results from the Open Field, Novel Object Recognition and Anhedonia, and Elevated Plus Maze behavior assays.\n",

      "Effects and interactions between different spaceflight stressors are expected to be experienced by crew on missions when exposed to microgravity and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). One of the limitations of previous studies on simulated weightlessness using hindlimb unloading (HU) is that a control HU condition was not included. We characterized the behavioral performance of male Fischer rats 2 months after sham or total body irradiation with a simplified 5-ion 6-mixed-beam exposure representative of GCRs in the absence or presence of HU. Six months later, the plasma, hippocampus, and cortex were processed to determine whether the behavioral effects were associated with long-term alterations in the metabolic pathways. In the open field without and with objects, interactions were observed for radiation × HU. In the plasma of animals that were not under the HU or control HU condition, the riboflavin metabolic pathway was affected most for sham irradiation vs. 0.75 Gy exposure. Analysis of the effects of control HU on plasma in the sham-irradiated animals showed that the alanine, aspartate, glutamate, riboflavin, and glutamine metabolisms as well as arginine biosynthesis were affected. The effects of control HU on the hippocampus in the sham-irradiated animals showed that the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan pathway was affected the most. Analysis of effects of 0.75 Gy irradiation on the cortex of control HU animals showed that the glutamine and glutamate metabolic pathway was affected similar to the hippocampus, while the riboflavin pathway was affected in animals that were not under the control HU condition. The effects of control HU on the cortex in sham-irradiated animals showed that the riboflavin metabolic pathway was affected. Animals receiving 0.75 Gy of irradiation showed impaired glutamine and glutamate metabolic pathway, whereas animals receiving 1.5 Gy of irradiation showed impaired riboflavin metabolic pathways. A total of 21 plasma metabolites were correlated with the behavioral measures, indicating that plasma and brain biomarkers associated with behavioral performance are dependent on the environmental conditions experienced. This study derives results from the Open Field and Novel Object Recognition behavior assays.\n",

      "Background: Excessive or inappropriate radiation exposure can cause serious damage to organisms. Radiation-induced thymus injury (RITI) is a serious complication associated with radiation and is mediated by RNAs. Methods: The thymus tissues of mice were analyzed using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and their libraries 24 h after exposure to 6 Gy of X-ray radiation. The target mRNAs were functionally annotated and the target lncRNA-based miRNAs and miRNA-based mRNAs were predicted after irradiation to develop the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA axis.\n",

      "Analyses of effects of lunar materials on plants: This study was designed to determine if lunar material can cause disease in plants grown under controlled conditions and to assess the effects of lunar materials on the germination and subsequent development of seeds of species belonging to the Tracheophyta (vascular plants). Due to the historic nature of these experiments some metadata is absent or unclear in the available documentation. At OSDR we welcome contributions from our community. If you review the material associated with this dataset and have a suggestion for an improvement, correction or addition please let us know at arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov.\n",

      "The following general conclusions can be made concerning the use of tissue culture for assaying the effects of mineral elements from simulated lunar soil or other mineral samples: The method used here is a very sensitive one for showing that soluble materials are reaching the tissue explant. The effects found (inhibiting) are very probably caused by excess toxic materials or competition of non-essential elements with essential elements rather than pH changes because previously pH has been found- to have relatively little effect over a wide range. Any stimulatory effect of the simulated lunar soil will probably appear at concentrations below those used in these experiments. If this is the case, the method is much less wasteful of mineral materials than methods in which pre-grown callus is treated with mineral materials. Measurements of uptake of minerals will be difficult in this system because of the relatively small growth obtainable from the tissue and also because of the apparently large background of minerals contributed by the purified agar.\n",

      "Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) has shown the effects of microgravity on multiple organs. To investigate the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system, we developed a unique organoid strategy for modeling specific regions of the brain that are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. We generated 3-dimensional human neural organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals affected by primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and non-symptomatic controls, by differentiating them toward cortical and dopaminergic fates, respectively, and combined them with isogenic microglia. The organoids were cultured for a month using a novel sealed cryovial culture method on the International Space Station (ISS) and a parallel set that remained on Earth. Live samples were returned to Earth for analysis by RNA expression and histology and were attached to culture dishes to enable neurite outgrowth. Our results show that both cortical and dopaminergic organoids cultured in LEO had lower levels of genes associated with cell proliferation and higher levels of maturation-associated genes, suggesting that the cells matured more quickly in LEO. This study is continuing with several more missions in order to understand the mechanisms underlying accelerated maturation and to investigate other neurological diseases. Our goal is to make use of the opportunity to study neural cells in LEO to better understand and treat neurodegenerative disease on Earth and to help ameliorate potentially adverse neurological effects of space travel. This study hosts data from cortical organoids. Data for the dopaminergic organoids is available under OSD-871.\n",

      "With technological advancements, human's desire to explore space is growing and more people are staying longer at the international space station (ISS). The impact of microgravity on stem cells (SC) is not fully understood. We explored the impact of microgravity on gene expression profile of cultured mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) at the ISS. We also evaluated how the new knowledge gained sheds light on our understanding of human physiology on Earth. Primary cultures of MSCs were expanded at the ISS for 1 or 2 weeks and mRNA was isolated from samples of the cultured cells. Gene expression profiles were determined and compared with samples from real-time ground control cultures. Differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis and determination of key genes were performed that revealed for the first time the existence of potential 'master regulators' coordinating a systemic response to microgravity. Cyclin D1 (CCND1), a protein-coding gene that regulates cell cycle progression and CDK kinases, was identified as the most connected regulator at week 1. Further analysis showed the impacted genes from cultured MSCs significantly correlated with known gene pathways associated with cell division, chromosomal segregation and nuclear division, extracellular matrix structure and organization, muscle apoptosis and differentiation. This study exemplifies the utility of space research to advance our understanding of human physiology both on Earth and in space. To investigate the effects of microgravity on MSC growth and understand the differences in gene expression profiles between microgravity and ground control environments, two groups of MSC were sent to the ISS. One group was cultured for one week, while the other was cultured for two weeks, with corresponding control groups processed similarly on Earth. The cells were then preserved and transferred back to the laboratory. Further Gene expression profiles were compared between samples to identify differentially expressed genes.\n",

      "Research conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth orbit (LEO) has shown the effects of microgravity on multiple organs. To investigate the effects of microgravity on the central nervous system, we developed a unique organoid strategy for modeling specific regions of the brain that are affected by neurodegenerative diseases. We generated 3-dimensional human neural organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals affected by primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or Parkinson's disease (PD) and non-symptomatic controls, by differentiating them toward cortical and dopaminergic fates, respectively, and combined them with isogenic microglia. The organoids were cultured for a month using a novel sealed cryovial culture method on the International Space Station (ISS) and a parallel set that remained on Earth. Live samples were returned to Earth for analysis by RNA expression and histology and were attached to culture dishes to enable neurite outgrowth. Our results show that both cortical and dopaminergic organoids cultured in LEO had lower levels of genes associated with cell proliferation and higher levels of maturation-associated genes, suggesting that the cells matured more quickly in LEO. This study is continuing with several more missions in order to understand the mechanisms underlying accelerated maturation and to investigate other neurological diseases. Our goal is to make use of the opportunity to study neural cells in LEO to better understand and treat neurodegenerative disease on Earth and to help ameliorate potentially adverse neurological effects of space travel. This study hosts data from dopaminergic organoids. Data for the cortical organoids is available under OSD-863.\n",

      "To investigate the molecular mechanisms governing the transition of skeletal muscle from atrophy to compensatory regeneration and hypertrophy, we employed a mouse model involving hindlimb unloading and subsequent reloading, conducting a comprehensive analysis of global gene expression using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gastrocnemius muscle samples were obtained from three groups: control mice, mice subjected to 10 days of hindlimb unloading-induced muscle atrophy, and mice reintroduced to normal cage activity for 1 day following the unloading period (reloading). Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for mouse gastrocnemius muscle from model of hindlimb unloading/reloading assessing transitions from atrophy to compensatory regeneration and hypertrophy. Control mice were kept in conventional cages throughout the entire protocol. Experiment was performed in replicates (Control n equals 4, Unloading n equals 2, Reloading n equals 3). Paired-end DNA libraries were prepared using Illumina TrueSeq and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000.\n",

      "We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA Scanning assay using lumbar spine tissue from HLS mice. The lumbar spine data in this study are related to other studies using tissues from the same experiment; OSD-654 (tibia), OSD-660 (tibialis anterior), OSD-662 (soleus), OSD-663 (femur), and OSD-664 (extensor digitorum longus).\n",
